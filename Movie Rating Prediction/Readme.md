# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Theoretical Overview

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries

In any data science project, the first step is to import the necessary libraries that provide various functions and methods required for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. In this project, the libraries used include:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

### 2. Load the Dataset

The project utilizes three datasets:

- **Movies Dataset**: Contains information about movies including movie IDs, names, and categories.
- **Ratings Dataset**: Includes user ratings for movies, along with timestamps.
- **Users Dataset**: Provides demographic information about users such as gender, age, occupation, and zip code.

These datasets are loaded into Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation and analysis.

### 3. Merge the Datasets

To perform a comprehensive analysis and build a predictive model, the datasets need to be merged into a single DataFrame. This involves joining the datasets on common keys:

- The Movies dataset is merged with the Ratings dataset on `movie_id`.
- The combined dataset is then merged with the Users dataset on `user_id`.

### 4. Data Exploration

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. This includes:

- Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the main characteristics of the data.
- Data Types and Info: Checking the data types and presence of missing values.
- Duplicate Values: Identifying and handling duplicate records.

### 5. Data Analysis

Further analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of ratings and other key insights:

- Grouping Ratings: Aggregating the number of ratings and the average rating for each movie.
- Visualization: Plotting histograms and heatmaps to visualize data distributions and correlations.

### 6. Data Visualization

Visualization techniques help in uncovering patterns and insights from the data:

- Histogram of Ratings: Shows the distribution of movie ratings.
- Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between different features.

### 7. Model Building

The core of the project is to build a predictive model. Steps involved:

- Feature Selection: Identifying independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).
- Data Splitting: Dividing data into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: Using Linear Regression to learn relationships.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing performance with R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 8. Results

The performance of the Linear Regression model is evaluated based on metrics like training and testing accuracy and MSE.

## Conclusion

The results suggest potential limitations of the Linear Regression model and propose future work with advanced techniques like collaborative filtering or neural networks.
